# A Gnome Alley
*An exercise in presence, perception, and poetic disruption.*

## What This Is
*A Gnome Alley* is a slow, site-specific game for creative people who enjoy bending meaning, distorting reality, and leaving strange traces behind.  
Each week, players receive a constellation of constraints, drawn from three card decks, that invite them to make something small, strange, and possibly invisible. The results are not shown in galleries. They are installed in the world, quietly.

This is not a game of winning. It is a practice of noticing, making, and shifting the texture of everyday life.  
It is a journey of self-discovery, of exploring your place in the world through small acts of creative intervention. The work that emerges is not just about the world around you, but also about your relationship to it, drawing from your own experiences and emotions to create something deeply personal, yet mysteriously connected to the world beyond.

## How to Play
### 1. Gather your group.  
This can be played solo, with a few friends, or with a whole community. One person acts as **Facilitator** for the week. This role can rotate.

### 2. Draw your cards.  
At the start of each week, the Facilitator draws:
- **1 Gesture card** - what you must do or make
- **1 Focus card** - what must be altered
- **1 Aura card** - how the work must exist

These three cards form the **creative prompt** for the week, inviting you to interact with the world and reflect on what lies within and around you.

### 3. Go into the world.  
Each participant uses the cards to create a subtle, site-specific intervention. This could be an installation, a message, a rearrangement, a presence, or something harder to name. It can be **tangible, ephemeral, or invisible**.  
The only rule: it must **exist in the world**, not just in your head.

The work you create can draw deeply from **personal experience**, emotions, memories, or reflections. This is not just about making something for others; it is about **discovering something about yourself** and your connection to the world around you. Let the process become a quiet **dialogue with your own being**.

### 4. Midweek: Optional Fate card  
Halfway through the week, the Facilitator may draw **1 Fate card**.  
This is optional: a gentle reflection, an invitation to shift your perspective or deepen your exploration. If you feel the need for a subtle nudge, draw one, otherwise continue with your process. Let it guide you, or leave it behind.

### 5. Return & reflect.  
At the end of the week, gather to reflect, not on the work itself, but on the **experience** of creating it. Share what emerged, what surprised you, and what you discovered along the way. The journey is just as important as the outcome, and sometimes the act of reflection will reveal more than the work itself.

Instead of showing your creation, share a **trace** of it: a photograph, a short video, a sound, a note, or any fragment that holds the essence of your intervention. Let these traces speak to the **emotional** or **conceptual** impact of the piece without needing to present it in its entirety. Each trace becomes a window into your experience and offers others a glimpse of the world as you shaped it.

## Some Notes
- You may follow the cards strictly or let them slip.  
- You may collaborate, or remain anonymous.  
- You may revisit your piece days later, or never again.  
- The world does not need to know it’s playing.

This game is about both the process and the discovery. Let the work be a reflection of you, but also an exploration into what it means to exist in the world, in a way that only you can.
